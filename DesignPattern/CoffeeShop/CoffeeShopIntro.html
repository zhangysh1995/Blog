The project is due in one week: by the midnight on the day of the next
lab. Make sure to include your name in comments of the source
files.

<li>A "Coffee Shack" serves coffee to its customers that is composed of
the base coffee: large ($3.00), medium ($2.00) or small ($1.00) and
added ingredients: sprinkles ($.50), caramel ($.20), milk foam ($.40),
ice ($0.10). The ingredients can be added in any order and
multiple times. Here is an example dialog for the order (customer's
input is in bold):
<p>
</p><ul>
<samp>Welcome to Coffee Shack, can I get you [l]arge, [m]edium, or [s]mall coffee? <b>m</b><br>

Code the service of "Coffee Shack" program using Decorator Design Pattern. 
Use header file(drink.h)</a> to define your base class.
<p>
</p></li><li>Extend your program as follows. In "Coffee Shack", the barista
takes the customers' order and then prepares their drunks. The barista
may serve her customers concurrently. Once the drink is ready, the
customers are notified. Specifically, after taking an order, the
barista randomly either notifies all customers that of one the drinks
is ready, the drinks may not necessarily be prepared in the FIFO
order, or starts taking a new order.  Code the service of "Coffee
Shack" using Observer Design Pattern. <samp>Customer</samp> objects
should be registering with <samp>Barista</samp> object and being
notified when a drink is ready. All customers could be notified at
once. Then, each customer should determine if it is her drink.
<p>
</p></li><li>Extend our <samp>Barista</samp> class so that it contains three
different experience
levels: <samp>JuniorBarista</samp>, <samp>SeniorBarista</samp>, <samp>Manager</samp>. Junior
Barista may only prepare drinks with no added ingredients. Senior
Barista may handle all added ingredients except for milk foam. Manager
may handle all ingredients. Implement your barista class using Chain
of Responsibility design pattern. In your dialog make sure to print,
which experience level barista is preparing the order.
</li></ul>
